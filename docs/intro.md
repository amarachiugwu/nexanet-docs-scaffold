# NexaNet

NexaNet is an optimistic Layer‑2 for EVM-compatible chains that uses a lightweight zk‑sync mechanism to accelerate finality and reduce gas costs. This documentation helps developers, integrators, and contributors use and build on NexaNet.

### Highlights

- Fast transaction finality (less than 2s optimistic confirmations)
- Low gas fee batching
- On‑chain dispute/game of fraud proofs
- Easy developer UX: SDKs, JSON-RPC compatibility, and a CLI

### What this docs prove

This documentation shows how to setup the dev environment, understand the protocol internals, run testnets, integrate via SDKs and JSON‑RPC, and how to contribute.
